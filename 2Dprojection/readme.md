# 2D Vector Projection Demonstration

GeoGebra App designed to visually demonstrate how a 2D vector projection works, by using an analogy of a one vector casting a shadow onto the other vector. 

## To-Do List

* Figure out how to bold text in GeoGebra
* Create light source for other vector arrangements (drag V to the other side and the light projection doesn't work as intended)
